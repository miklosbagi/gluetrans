# GlueTrans Tests
Please note that in order to use any of this, the following variables need to be exported in the shell:
- `GLUETRANS_VPN_USERNAME` — PIA OpenVPN username
- `GLUETRANS_VPN_PASSWORD` — PIA OpenVPN password
- `GLUETRANS_VPN_REGIONS` — PIA **`SERVER_REGIONS`** for Gluetun (comma-separated region names as in [Gluetun’s PIA wiki](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/providers/private-internet-access.md)); pick regions that support **port forwarding**. Example shape: `Switzerland,DE Berlin,FI Helsinki,France` (adjust to regions you verify work in your account).
- `GLUETRANS_TRANSMISSION_USERNAME`
- `GLUETRANS_TRANSMISSION_PASSWORD`

These are utilized via [.env](./.env).

## Test infrastructure
`make test-env-start` and `make test-env-stop` to start and stop the test environment.
Components:
- Gluetun (**Private Internet Access** / OpenVPN in CI)
- Transmisison
- GlueTrans

Please take a look at the [docker-compose](./docker-compose-build.yaml) file.

## Linters
`make lint`
- Shellcheck is used for shell scripts: `shellcheck entrypoint.sh`
- Hadolint is used for dockerfile: `hadolint Dockerfile`

## Smoke pack
`make test-run-smoke` (depends on test infrastructure).

Coverage:
1. Active gluetun is detected.
1. Port change is detected.
1. Transmission port update is successful.
1. Heartbeat is happening.
1. Gluetun and Transmission ports end up matching.
1. Transmission reports port is open.
1. Country jump timer is running.
1. Asking gluetun to disconnect.
1. Country Jump.
